      <h1>About the Incodables CodeU Chat App</h1>
      <p>
        This is an example chat application designed to be a starting point
        for your CodeU project team work. Here's some stuff to think about:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algorithms and data structures:</strong> We've made the app
            and the code as simple as possible. You will have to extend the
            existing data structures to support your enhancements to the app,
            and also make changes for performance and scalability as your app
            increases in complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Look and feel:</strong> The focus of CodeU is on the Java
          side of things, but if you're particularly interested you might use
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the chat app prettier.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Think about a group you care about.
          What needs do they have? How could you help? Think about technical
          requirements, privacy concerns, and accessibility and
          internationalization.</li>
      </ul>
